	 		<h3><small>In 1912 the Titanic was touted as <b>The Unsinkable Ship</b>.<br/>  Obviously history shows this was nonsense, 
	 		as on 15th April 1912 the Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic ocean. </small></h3>

			<blockquote>"What do you think I am? Do you believe that I'm the sort that would have left that ship as long as there were any women and children on board? That's the thing that hurts, and it hurts all the more because it is so false and baseless. I have searched my mind with deepest care, I have thought long over each single incident that I coulrecall of that wreck. I'm sure that nothing wrong was 
			done; that I did nothing that I should not have done. My conscience is clear and I have not been a lenient judge of my own acts."
